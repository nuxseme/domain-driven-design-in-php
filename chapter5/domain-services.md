Throughout conversations with domain experts, you will come across concepts in the Ubiquitous Language that cannot be neatly represented as either an Entity or Value.



* A user being able to sign-in to a system by themselves?
* A cart being able to be promoted to an order by itself?



The examples above are two concrete concepts which can not naturally be bound to either an Entity or a Value Object. Further highlighting this oddity, we can attempt to model the behavior as follows

```php
class User
{
    public  function  signIn($aUsername,  $aPassword)
    {
// ...
    }
}



class Cart
{
    public function createOrder()
    {
// ...
    }
}

```

In the case of the first implementation, we are not able to know that the given username and password relate to the invoked-upon user instance. Clearly this operation does not suit this Entity, instead it should be extracted out into a separate class, making its intention explicit.

With this thought in mind we could create a domain service with the sole responsibility to authenticate users.

```php
class SignIn
{
    public  function  execute($aUsername,  $aPassword)
    {
// ...
    }
}
```

Or similarly, in the case of the second example, a domain service specialised in creating orders from a supplied cart.



```php
class CreateOrderFromCart
{
    public function execute(Cart $aCart)
    {
// ...
    }
}
```

A domain service can be defined as an operation that fulfills a domain task and naturally does not fit into either an Entity nor a Value Object. As a concept that represents an operation in the domain, they should be used by clients regardless of its run history. Domain services donâ€™t hold any kind of state by themselves, so domain services are stateless operations.
