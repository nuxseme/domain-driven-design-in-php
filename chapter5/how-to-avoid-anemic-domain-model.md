The way to avoid falling into an anemic domain model is to instead when starting a new project or feature, to think of the behaviour first. Databases, ORMs, and so on are just implementation details, and we should strive to push the decision to use these tools as late in the development process as we can. In doing this we can focus on the one true attribute that matters, the behaviour.
