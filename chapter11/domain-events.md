Domain Event listeners have to be configured before the Application Service gets executed or nobody will be noticed. There are situations where youâ€™ll have to be explicitly and configure the listener before executing the Application Service.



```php
//...
$subscriber = new SpySubscriber();
DomainEventPublisher::instance()->subscribe($subscriber);
$applicationService = //...
$applicationService->execute(...);
```

Most of the time this will be done by configuring the Dependency Injection Container.
