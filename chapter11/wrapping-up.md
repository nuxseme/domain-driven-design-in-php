Application Services represent the Application layer of your Bounded Context. These high-level use cases should be pretty simple and skinny as their purpose evolves around Domain coordination. Application Services are the entry point for Domain logic interaction. We’ve seen that Requests and Commands keep things organised, DTO’s and Data Transformers allow us to decouple data representation from Domain conceptualisation, that building Application Services is pretty straightforward with Dependency Injection Containers and that we have plenty of options for combining Application Services in complex layouts.
