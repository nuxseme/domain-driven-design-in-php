On your journey for applying Domain-Driven Design, you will encounter several challenges.  
Applying Domain-Driven Design completely will require thinking about the business domain,  
terminology, research and collaboration with domain experts rather than coding jargon. It will  
require time and effort.  
You need to have the commitment of Domain experts for getting involved in the process of building  
software. You will need domain experts to uncover deep knowledge of the domain. It will require  
an open, healthy, respectful and continuous conversation with the experts to model their spoken  
language into software.  
We developers are technical thinkers. Technical solutions are our speciality. Thinking in technical  
problems is not bad, the only problem is that sometimes thinking less technically is better. In order  
to think in the behaviours of objects we need to think in the Ubiquitous Language first.

在应用领域驱动设计的过程中，您将遇到几个挑战。完全应用领域驱动设计需要考虑业务领域、术语、研究和与领域专家的协作，而不是编写代码。这需要时间和努力。  
您需要有领域专家参与构建软件的过程。您将需要领域专家来发现领域的深层知识。它需要与专家进行公开、健康、尊重和持续的对话，以将他们的口语转化为软件。  
我们开发人员是更多站在技术角度。技术解决方案是我们的专长。  
在技术问题上思考并不坏，唯一的问题是有时候少思考技术问题更好。在思考对象行为之前我们需要考虑通用语言
