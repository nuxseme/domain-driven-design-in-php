Implementing Domain-Driven Design requires effort. If it were easy everybody would be writinghigh-quality code. Get ready because through this journey you will learn how to make your designlook exactly how your software works. During this chapter you have learned:

* Domain-Driven Design is not about technology, is actually about providing value in the fieldyou are working on, by focusing on model. Everyone takes part in the process of discoveringthe domain, developers and domain experts team up to build the knowledge base by sharingthe same language, the Ubiquitous Language.* Domain-Drive Design provides tactical and strategic modeling tools to design high-qualitysoftware. Strategic design targets the business direction, helps defining the internal relationshipsand technically protects each business service by defining strong boundaries. Tacticaldesign provides useful building blocks for iterative design.* We have studied the context in which DDD makes sense. DDD is not a silver bullet for everyproblem in Software, and highly depends on the amount of complexity you are dealing with.* We have also seen that applying DDD is a long-term investment, it requires active effort.Domain experts will be required to collaborate closely with developers, and developers willhave to think in terms of the business. In the end, it is the business customer that is the onethat has to be pleased.

实现DDD需要付出努力。如此每个人都可以写出高质量的代码。在这个过程中你将会学习到设计即代码：

* DDD不是关于技术的。关注模型，在当前的业务领域提供有效的价值。每个人开发者，领域专家通过通用语言共享业务知识
* DDD提供战略和战术构建工具设计高质量的软件。战略设计以业务方向为目标，帮助定义内部关系。通过定义业务边界保护每个业务服务。战术设计为迭代设计提供了有用的构建模块。
* 研究背景决定是否采用DDD，DDD不是银弹。是否采用由当前问题的复杂程度决定
* 应用DDD是一个长期的过程，需要不断付出努力。领域专家需要跟开发者紧密合作，开发者也需要深入理解业务。最后使设计的产品达到满意
