Modules are a way of grouping and separating concepts in our domain model. Modules should be named following the Ubiquitous Language. We should not forget that Modules are a way to communicate high-level concepts, it helps us keeping coupling low and cohesion high. We’ve seen that we could create meaningful modules even in old versions of PHP by using prefixes. Nowadays it’s easy to build our Modules following the PSR-0 and PSR-4 namespacing conventions.
