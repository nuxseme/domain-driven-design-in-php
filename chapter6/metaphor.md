I go to Babur’s for a meal on Tuesday, and pay by credit card. This might be modelled as an event, whose event type is PurchasePlaced, whose subject is my credit card, and whose occurred date is Tuesday. If Babur’s uses an old manual system and doesn’t transmit the transaction until Friday, the noticed date would be Friday.

Things happen. Not all of them are interesting, some may be worth recording but don’t provoke a reaction. The most interesting ones cause a reaction. Many systems need to react to interesting events. Often you need to know why a system reacts in the way it did.

By funneling inputs to a system into streams of Domain Events you can keep a record of all the inputs to a system. This helps you organize your processing logic, and also allows you to keep an audit log of the inputs to the system.
