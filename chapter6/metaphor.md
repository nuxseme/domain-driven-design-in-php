I go to Babur’s for a meal on Tuesday, and pay by credit card. This might be modelled as an event, whose event type is PurchasePlaced, whose subject is my credit card, and whose occurred date is Tuesday. If Babur’s uses an old manual system and doesn’t transmit the transaction until Friday, the noticed date would be Friday.

Things happen. Not all of them are interesting, some may be worth recording but don’t provoke a reaction. The most interesting ones cause a reaction. Many systems need to react to interesting events. Often you need to know why a system reacts in the way it did.

By funneling inputs to a system into streams of Domain Events you can keep a record of all the inputs to a system. This helps you organize your processing logic, and also allows you to keep an audit log of the inputs to the system.

我星期二去巴布尔饭店吃饭，用信用卡付款。这可能被建模为一个事件，其事件类型为purchaseplace，其主题是我的信用卡，其发生日期为星期二。如果Babur使用的是旧的手动系统，并且直到周五才传输事务，则通知日期为周五。

事情发生。并不是所有的都很有趣，有些可能值得记录，但不要引起任何反应。最有趣的会引起反应。许多系统需要对有趣的事件作出反应。通常你需要知道为什么系统会有这样的反应。

通过将系统的输入汇集到域事件流中，您可以对系统的所有输入进行记录。这可以帮助您组织处理逻辑，并允许您保留系统输入的审计日志。
