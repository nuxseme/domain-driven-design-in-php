All events should be represented as verbs in the past tense such as CustomerRelocated, CargoShipped, or InventoryLossageRecorded. They are things that have completed in the past. There are interesting examples in the English language where one may be tempted to use nouns as opposed to verbs in the past tense, an example of this would be “Earthquake” or “Capsize”, as a congressman recently worried about Guam. We suggest to avoid the temptation of using names like those for Domain Events and stick with the usage of verbs in the past tense. Nouns tend to match up with “Transaction Objects” discussed later from Streamlined Object Modeling. It’s imperative to model events as past tense verbs as they are part of the Ubiquitous Language.

所有事件都应表示为过去时态的动词，如customerlocate、CargoShipped或inventorylossagerecded。它们是过去完成的事情。英语中有一些有趣的例子，在这些例子中，人们可能会倾向于使用名词而不是过去时中的动词，例如“地震”或“倾覆”，就像一位国会议员最近担心关岛的情况一样。我们建议避免在领域事件中使用类似的名称，坚持使用动词的过去式。名词往往与Streamlined对象建模中稍后讨论的“事务对象”相匹配。必须将事件建模为过去时动词，因为它们是普遍语言的一部分。
