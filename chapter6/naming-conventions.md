All events should be represented as verbs in the past tense such as CustomerRelocated, Cargo- Shipped, or InventoryLossageRecorded. They are things that have completed in the past. There are interesting examples in the English language where one may be tempted to use nouns as opposed to verbs in the past tense, an example of this would be “Earthquake” or “Capsize”, as a congressman recently worried about Guam. We suggest to avoid the temptation of using names like those for Domain Events and stick with the usage of verbs in the past tense. Nouns tend to match up with “Transaction Objects” discussed later from Streamlined Object Modeling. It’s imperative to model events as past tense verbs as they are part of the Ubiquitous Language.
