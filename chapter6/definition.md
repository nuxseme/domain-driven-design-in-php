Domain Events are one specific type of event used for notifying Domain changes to local or remote Bounded Contexts. 

Vaughn Vernon defines² a Domain Event as as 



    an occurrence capture of something what happened in the domain.



Eric Evans defines³ a Domain Event as 



    a full-fledged part of the domain model, a representation of something that happened in the domain. Ignore irrelevant domain activity while making explicit the events that the domain experts want to track or be notified of, or which are associated with state change in the other model objects.



Martin Fowler defines⁴ a Domain Event as captures the memory of something interesting which affects the domain.



Examples of Domain Events in a Web application are UserRegistered, OrderPlaced, UserRelocated

or ProductAdded.
