Consider the following examples from WikipediaÂ³, to better understand the difference between Value Objects and Entities. When people exchange dollar bills, they generally do not distinguish between each unique bill. They are instead only concerned with the face value of the dollar bill. In this context, dollar bills are Value Objects. However, the Federal Reserve might be interested in tracking bills as unique identities and therefore treat them as Entities.

Another example could be that many airlines differentiate among seats, treating them as unique locations. In this instance, a seat can be considered an Entity. On the other hand, there are airlines such as Southwest Airlines \(or EasyJet/Ryanair in Europe\) that do not differentiate among seats. In this context, a seat could be treated as a Value Object.

Exercise

In regard to the concept of an address \(street, number, zip code, etc.\). When would be a possible context where an address could be modelled as an Entity and not as a Value Object? Discuss your findings with a peer.
