Consider the following examples from Wikipedia³, to better understand the difference between Value Objects and Entities. When people exchange dollar bills, they generally do not distinguish between each unique bill. They are instead only concerned with the face value of the dollar bill. In this context, dollar bills are Value Objects. However, the Federal Reserve might be interested in tracking bills as unique identities and therefore treat them as Entities.

Another example could be that many airlines differentiate among seats, treating them as unique locations. In this instance, a seat can be considered an Entity. On the other hand, there are airlines such as Southwest Airlines \(or EasyJet/Ryanair in Europe\) that do not differentiate among seats. In this context, a seat could be treated as a Value Object.

考虑下面的例子从维基百科³,为了更好地理解值对象和实体之间的区别。当人们兑换美元钞票时，他们通常不会区分每一张单独的钞票。相反，他们只关心美元的面值。在这种情况下，美钞是价值对象。不过，美联储可能对将票据作为独特身份进行追踪感兴趣，因此会将其视为实体。

另一个例子可能是，许多航空公司会对座位进行区分，将它们视为独特的位置。在这种情况下，一个座位可以被认为是一个实体。另一方面，西南航空\(Southwest airlines\)\(或欧洲的易捷航空\(EasyJet/Ryanair\)\)等航空公司不区分座位。在这种情况下，可以将座位视为值对象。
