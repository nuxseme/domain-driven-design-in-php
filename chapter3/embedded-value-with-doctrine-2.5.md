As of this writing, Doctrine stable release is currently 2.4. Doctrine 2.5 is under development and it comes with support for mapping Value Objects, removing the need to do this yourself. For now however, it looks like Doctrine has no support for nested embeddables. For now, check the Doctrine Embeddables reference¹² for more information. This option, if implemented correctly, is definitely the one that we most recommend. This would be the simplest, most elegant solution, also providing search support in your DQL queries. However, at this time, it is not an option in a production environment. Rest assured we will update the book as soon as this scenario changes.
