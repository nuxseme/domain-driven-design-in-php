As of this writing, Doctrine stable release is currently 2.4. Doctrine 2.5 is under development and it comes with support for mapping Value Objects, removing the need to do this yourself. For now however, it looks like Doctrine has no support for nested embeddables. For now, check the Doctrine Embeddables reference¹² for more information. This option, if implemented correctly, is definitely the one that we most recommend. This would be the simplest, most elegant solution, also providing search support in your DQL queries. However, at this time, it is not an option in a production environment. Rest assured we will update the book as soon as this scenario changes.



在撰写本文时，Doctrine的稳定版本目前是2.4。Doctrine 2.5正在开发中，它提供了对映射值对象的支持，从而消除了您自己进行映射的需要。然而，就目前而言，Doctrine似乎不支持嵌套的可嵌入项。现在,检查原则可嵌入参考¹²的更多信息。如果实现正确，这个选项肯定是我们最推荐的选项。这将是最简单、最优雅的解决方案，并在DQL查询中提供搜索支持。但是，此时在生产环境中还不能使用它。请放心，一旦这个场景发生变化，我们将立即更新该书。
