Following on with the e-commerce example, think about reporting revenue to an old legacy retailer financial system. The integration could be so expensive resulting in it not being worth the effort to implement. This is called in DDD strategic terms Separate Ways.

> Integration is always expensive. Sometimes the benefit is small. So Declare a BOUNDED CONTEXT to have no connection to the others at all, allowing developers to find simple, specialized solutions within this small scope.

在电子商务示例之后，考虑向旧的遗留零售商财务系统报告收入。集成可能非常昂贵，因此不值得进行实现。这在DDD战略术语中被称为不同的方式。



> 集成总是很昂贵的。有时好处很小。因此，声明一个有限的上下文与其他上下文完全没有连接，从而允许开发人员在这个小范围内找到简单的、专门的解决方案。
