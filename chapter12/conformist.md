Consider again the e-commerce example and integration with a third party shipping service. Your domain and theirs differ in models, teams and infrastructure. They will not participate in your product plannings or provide any solutions to the e-commerce system. These teams do not have a close relationship. We could choose to accept and conform to their domain model. This is what we call in strategic design a Conformist Integration



> Eliminate the complexity of translation between BOUNDED CONTEXTS by slavishly adhering to the model of the upstream team. Although this cramps the style of the down- stream designers and probably does not yield the ideal model for the application, choosing CONFORMITY enormously simplifies integration. Also, you will share a UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE with your supplier team. The supplier is in the driverâ€™s seat, so it is good to make communication easy for them. Altruism may be sufficient to get them to share information with you.
