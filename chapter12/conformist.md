Consider again the e-commerce example and integration with a third party shipping service. Your domain and theirs differ in models, teams and infrastructure. They will not participate in your product plannings or provide any solutions to the e-commerce system. These teams do not have a close relationship. We could choose to accept and conform to their domain model. This is what we call in strategic design a Conformist Integration

> Eliminate the complexity of translation between BOUNDED CONTEXTS by slavishly adhering to the model of the upstream team. Although this cramps the style of the down- stream designers and probably does not yield the ideal model for the application, choosing CONFORMITY enormously simplifies integration. Also, you will share a UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE with your supplier team. The supplier is in the driver’s seat, so it is good to make communication easy for them. Altruism may be sufficient to get them to share information with you.

再次考虑电子商务示例并与第三方配送服务集成。您的领域和他们的领域在模型、团队和基础设施方面是不同的。他们不会参与您的产品规划，也不会为您的电子商务系统提供任何解决方案。这些团队之间的关系并不密切。我们可以选择接受并遵循他们的领域模型。这就是我们在战略设计中所说的墨守成规的整合



> 通过盲目地遵循上游团队的模型，消除边界上下文之间转换的复杂性。虽然这限制了下游设计人员的风格，并且可能不会为应用程序生成理想的模型，但是选择一致性极大地简化了集成。此外，您将与供应商团队共享一种通用语言。供应商掌握着主动权，所以让他们更容易沟通是件好事。利他主义可能足以让他们与你分享信息。
