Every enterpise application is typically composed of several areas in which the company operates. Areas such as billing, inventory, shipping management, catalog and so on are common examples. The easiest manner in which to manage all these concerns may seem to lean towards a monolithic system. You might wonder, does it have to be this way? What if any friction garnered between teams working on these seperate areas could be reduced by splitting this big monolithic application into smaller, independent chunks. We will now be exploring how to do this, so get prepared for insights and heuristics around strategical design.
