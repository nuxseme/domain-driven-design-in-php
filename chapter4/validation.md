Validation is a highly important process in our domain model. It not only checks for the correctness of attributes, but entire objects and even the composition of those objects. Different levels of validation are required in order to keep this model in a valid state. Only because an object consists of valid attributes \(on a per-basis\), does not necessary mean the object \(as a whole\) is valid. Vice versa, valid objects do not necessarily mean we have valid compositions.
